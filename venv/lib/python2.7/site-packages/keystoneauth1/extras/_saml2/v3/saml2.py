        The federated authentication consists of:

        * HTTP GET request to the Identity Service (acting as a Service
          Provider).

          It's crucial to include HTTP headers indicating we are expecting SOAP
          message in return. Service Provider should respond with such SOAP
          message.  This step is handed by a method

          message  returned from the Service Provider. It's also worth noting
          that ECP extension to the SAML2 doesn't define authentication method.
          The most popular is HttpBasicAuth with just user and password.
          Other possibilities could be X509 certificates or Kerberos.
          Upon successful authentication the user should receive a SAML2
          assertion.
          This step is handed by a method
          ``Saml2Password_send_idp_saml2_authn_request(session)``

        * HTTP POST request again to the Service Provider. The body of the
          request includes SAML2 assertion issued by a trusted Identity
          Provider. The request should be sent to the Service Provider
          consumer url specified in the SAML2 assertion.
          Providing the authentication was successful and both Service Provider
          and Identity Providers are trusted to each other, the Service
          Provider will issue an unscoped token with a list of groups the
          federated user is a member of.
