         # return 0 for OK.  Otherwise, it will return 1 for an error

         # the url, reporting the response time in seconds.

         # The (optional) disable_ssl_validation will instruct the check

         # This is mostly useful when checking SSL connections signed with
         # certificates that are not themselves signed by a public authority.

         # The (optional) headers parameter allows you to send extra headers
         # with the request. This is useful for explicitly specifying the host
         # header or perhaps adding headers for authorisation purposes. Note
         # that the http client library converts all headers to lowercase.
         # This is legal according to RFC2616
         # (See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.2)
