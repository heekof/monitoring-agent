         # The (optional) disable_ssl_validation will instruct the check
         # to skip the validation of the SSL certificate of the URL being tested.
         # This is mostly useful when checking SSL connections signed with
         # certificates that are not themselves signed by a public authority.

         # The (optional) headers parameter allows you to send extra headers

         # that the http client library converts all headers to lowercase.
         # This is legal according to RFC2616
         # (See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.2)
         # but may be problematic with some HTTP servers

         # separated by '/'), and the type of recording to use (counter, gauge,
         # rate, histogram, set). See the Plugins documentation about
         # http_metrics for more information about the different types.
