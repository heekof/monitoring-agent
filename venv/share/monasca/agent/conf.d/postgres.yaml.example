#  Custom-metrics section

#  You can now track per-relation (table) metrics
#  You need to specify the list. Each relation
#  generates a lot of metrics (10 + 10 per index)
#  so you want to only use the ones you really care about

#       relations:
#            - my_table
#            - my_other_table
