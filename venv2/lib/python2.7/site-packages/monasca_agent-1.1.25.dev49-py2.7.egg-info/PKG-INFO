        # Introduction
        The Monasca Agent is a modern Python monitoring agent for gathering metrics and sending them to the Monasca API. The Agent supports collecting metrics from a variety of sources as follows:
        
        * System metrics such as cpu and memory utilization.
        * Nagios plugins. The Monasca Agent can run Nagios plugins and send the status code returned by the plugin as a metric to the Monasca API.
        * Statsd. The Monasca Agent supports an integrated Statsd daemon which can be used by applications via a statsd client library.
        * Host alive. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on a host to determine if it is alive using ping (ICMP) or 
        SSH.
        * Process checks. The Monasca Agent can check a process and return several metrics on the process such as number of instances, memory, io and threads.
        * Http Endpoint checks. The Monasca Agent can perform active checks on http endpoints by sending an HTTP request to an API.
        * Service checks. The Agent can check service such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, and many more.
        * OpenStack metrics.  The agent can perform checks on OpenStack processes.
        * The Agent can automatically detect and setup checks on certain processes and resources.
        
        The Agent is extensible through configuration of additional plugins, written in Python.
